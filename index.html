                    Interim is a 3rd person, isometric, sandbox and open-world videogame. Set in an unknown time in the future, the player must explore the unfamiliar world, gather resources, craft upgrades, and defeat monsters. By completing missions, you unlock more options for customization. Unique to Interim, you can edit buildings’ pixel art in-game and use it to decorate your world. This allows you to make the game completely unique to you.<br>

                    Besides building, you can also traverse the world and find new plants to place in your garden. Because of the isometric POV, the player is able to see large portions of the map, which is great for landscaping! This makes Interim a relaxing play, but don’t let that stop you from seeking dungeons to fight bosses, find loot, and uncover more about this world.<br>

                    All game controls are tied to just a computer mouse, but this can be reconfigured to a keyboard. Staying true to the game’s name, Interim is designed to be played during interims; there is very little commitment required to enjoy the game, but a very high creative ceiling.
