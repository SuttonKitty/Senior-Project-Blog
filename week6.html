                I had a lot of development this week. First, I added a tree chopping effect to my Unity project and mouse-only navigation.

                After working on this, however, I realized that I wanted to move to the Game Maker game engine because it specializes in 2D games. I have been watching a tutorial by

                    Peyton Burnham

                on how to make an RPG in Game Maker.

                The story of my game has also evolved. It takes place on an island in Limbo (between life and the afterlife) where a robot has to live. The motivation is to make it to "the other side". I am still developing the motivation though because it is not as intuitive as a human needing to survive (i.e. why does a robot need to farm, to fish, to explore?).
